my implementation of snake
Juan-Fernando Morales, 2022.

I have had this idea for a lil while now, writing snake 
and only saving the vertices in a list which you can pop/add to

TODO:

currently, doeesn't work when the snake is one line long. add feature for that

Add apples : P lol


DEPENDANCIES:

uses pyglet, uses python3
